An asynchronous wrapper for the official Clash Royale API.

Official API Link [https://developer.clashroyale.com](https://developer.clashroyale.com)

## Important note

This wrapper will only work from a nodejs server app. The official clash royale api is, unfortunately, blocking requests done directly from the browser.

## Getting started

In order to use the official api, you will need a token. This token can be obtained at the Official API website [https://developer.clashroyale.com](https://developer.clashroyale.com).

Once you register and get the token, you are ready to start.

## Usage

Install the package:

-   `yarn add @varandas/clash-royale-api`

OR

-   `npm i --save @varandas/clash-royale-api`

Usage:

```javascript
// Import the package
const { ClashRoyaleAPI } = require('@varandas/clash-royale-api')

// Initialize the api
const api = new ClashRoyaleAPI('the token you got from the api')

// Use the api to get cards
api.getCards()
    .then((cards) => {
        // Do something with the cards
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        // handle errors
    })
```

## Methods

All api calls are asynchronous and used in the same way as above in the getCards example.

     * If name is used as part of search query, it needs to be at least three
     * characters long. Name search parameter is interpreted as wild card
     * search, so it may appear anywhere in the clan name.
     */

    /**
     * Filter by clan location identifier. For list of available locations,
     * refer to getLocations operation.
     */
    locationId?: number
    /**
     * Filter by minimum amount of clan members.
     */
    minMembers?: number
    /**

     */
    minScore?: number
    /**
     * Limit the number of items returned in the response.
     */
    limit?: number
    /**
     * Return only items that occur after this marker.
     * After marker can be found from the response, inside the 'paging' property.
     * Note that only after or before can be specified for a request, not both.
     */
    after?: number
    /**
     * Return only items that occur before this marker.
     * Before marker can be found from the response, inside the 'paging' property.

     * Note that only after or before can be specified for a request, not both.
     */

}
```

**ILocationRequestParams**

```typescript
